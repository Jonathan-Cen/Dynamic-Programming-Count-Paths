# Dynamic-Programming-Count-Paths

This simple pathfinding game allows the user to specify obstacles (will be coloured in green) between the entry (a blue square that locates at the top-left corner) and the exit (a red square that locates at the bottom right corner) within an 8x8 grid. The game will calculate the number of different paths from the entry to the exit based on the obstacles specified by the user. This calculation utilizes the concept of dynamic programming. 

**Please note that valid movements are moving right and moving down.**

When the user finishes with specifying obstacles, simply click the ```Calculate``` button to find out the number of different paths. The user can also click ```Reset``` to reset the grid. Click any obstacles will unspecify them.
